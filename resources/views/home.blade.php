The Youths of Evangelical Reformed Church Christ (ERCC) understood the need for
a viable Youth Fellowship in the Church that will contribute substantially
to the upliftment of the lives of youths in the church as well as to impact
the Youths with burden for church development and missions that will lead to
the opening of more ERCC branches in various cities/villages in the nation as
well as in other nations of the world. This made them converge and form a National
Youth Fellowship that will stir the activities of youths in their various RCCs.
This led to the formation of the Youth Fellowship which started in Kaduna in 1996
when a National convention was organized by Youth Fellowship RCC Kaduna. The
convention was attended by youths from RCC Jos, RCC Lafia and RCC Randa.
During the convention, a seven man national steering committee  led by Pastor
Simon Akyenyi was set up to create awareness,  mobilize and bring all other Youth
groups in the Church under one umbrella  “The ERCC Youth Fellowship” and conduct a national election.
The seven-man committee was:
<ul style="color: rgb(0 0 0);">
<li>Pastor Simon Akenyi – Chairman </li>
<li>Bro. Ibrahim Umbugadu – Secretary</li>
<li>Sis. Janet Gangas – Treasurer </li>
<li>Bro. Zacks D. Umaru – Member </li>
<li>Bro. Ezekiel Ambissa Sabo – Member </li>
<li>Pastor Joseph Attah – Member </li>
<li>Bro. Joseph Ashison (late) – Member
</li>
</ul>
<p>
   The effort of this
committee was supported by the entire General Church Council (GCC) under the
leadership of V. Rev Adamu Mari – President and V. Rev Nuhu Idzi - General
Secretary. The Stirring committee worked tirelessly and was able to organize
her 1st National convention which was held at R.C.C. Akwanga in 1997, 2nd
Convention in 1998 which was held at RCC Lafia and the 3rd in 1999 in RCC
Keffi. During the 3rd convention at RCC Keffi, the steering committee was
dissolved and the first executive council of the Youth Fellowship was elected
and inaugurated. <br>The first executive council members of the Youth Fellowship are thus:

Youth Fellowship which was now formed by the Youth of the Church, replace it with the then
YMCA which was non functional as at the time Youth Fellowship was established.</p>
